# R-Project
The aim of the study was to understand how the several independent variables influenced  the dependent variables, TipPercentage and Bill. From our analysis we have arrived at several conclusions: 

A statistically significant association was identified between the numeric vs categorical variables Bill and Weekday. 

For the analysis of numeric vs numeric variables, Bill and PartySize, a statistically significant association was also distinguished.  By use of Spearman Rank Correlation test, a moderate correction was identified between Bill and PartySize.

For the regression analysis, we examined the relationship between Bill and PartySize. This analysis also proved a significant association between the variables. A positive linear relationship was identified from the model. 

We did not think our model was in need for improvement since it showed some meaningful relationship between our variables. But if there was a weaker relationship established by the model, checking for normality of residuals would help refine the model.
